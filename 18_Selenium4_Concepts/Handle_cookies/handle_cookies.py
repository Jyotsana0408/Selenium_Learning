Selenium provides several cookie management methods that allow you to interact with browser cookies during automation.
Here's a comprehensive guide to the available cookie methods in Selenium WebDriver (Python):

Cookie Methods in Selenium:

    Method	                    Description
    get_cookies()	            Returns a list of all cookies visible to the current page.
    get_cookie(name)	        Returns a dictionary with details of the cookie with the specified name.
    add_cookie(cookie_dict)	    Adds a cookie to the current session. The cookie must be a dictionary with at least name and value.
    delete_cookie(name)	        Deletes the cookie with the specified name.
    delete_all_cookies()	    Deletes all cookies from the browser for the current domain.

Notes & Tips:

    - You can only add cookies after navigating to a domain (driver.get(url)).
    - Cookies are domain-specificâ€”you can't add or access cookies for other domains.
    - Some cookies (like HttpOnly or Secure) may not be accessible via JavaScript or Selenium.
    - Adding cookies with expiry, path, or domain can be done like this:
            driver.add_cookie({
                "name": "my_cookie",
                "value": "123456",
                "path": "/",
                "domain": "demo.nopcommerce.com",
                "expiry": int(time.time()) + 3600  # 1 hour from now
            })

    delete_all_cookies() does work, but the site may immediately recreate one or more cookies due to:
    -Page reloads
    -Background AJAX calls
    -Embedded scripts
